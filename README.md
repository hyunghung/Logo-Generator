# Logo-Generator

For this project, I was asked to use node.js to run the program, jest to test the program, and inquirer, allowing me to ask user questions via command lines. I also learned how to make shapes using the SVG drawing. What made this challenging was figuring out how to connect the two files together, since I was able to implement the data with only one file page within index.js, however, the ask was to make two different files that one will generate the image and text, while the other one is called on. What made this easy was implementing node.js, installing all the files, and connecting user inputs with the wanted result. When using the program, the user will be asked a series of questions allowing them to make up their own logo: Text, Text Color, Shape, and Shape Color. After that, the program will generate the logo and leave it within the source-code editor//integrated development environment called "logo.svg"
